My workspace for speech related tasks, including single/multi-channel speech enhancement & separation & recognition. The goal is to make it easy, flexible and efficient to conduct experiments, verify ideas, implement and evaluate novel neural networks. The design and usage of the package are based on my experience in the last few years.
