# APS

My own workspace for several speech tasks, including single/multi-channel speech enhancement & separation & E2E speech recognition.

## Support

1. Single channel & Multi-channel acoustic model (Transducer & Encoder-Decoder structure with RNN, Transformer, TDNN, FSMN, ...)
2. Freqency & Time domain single & multi-channel speech enhancement/separation model
3. Distributed training (now using Pytorch's DistributedDataParallel)
4. Kaldi features & PyTorch-based feature extraction
